# Disease Predictor

The detection and classification of crop diseases is an essential use of DL, ML, and computer vision techniques in agriculture industries [1]. The aim is to develop algorithms and techniques based on images of leaves or other plant features that can automatically detect and classify agricultural plant diseases using Machine Learning based on the Kaggle Datasets.
